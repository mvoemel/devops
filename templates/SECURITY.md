# Security Policy

Ensuring the security of our project is a top priority, and we appreciate your help in identifying vulnerabilities responsibly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, we ask that you **do not** open a public issue to discuss it. Instead, please report it privately by emailing us at **[security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)**. This helps protect our users by allowing us to address the issue before it becomes publicly known.

We are committed to promptly addressing all security reports and will work with you to fully understand and fix the issue as quickly as possible. We will also inform relevant stakeholders about the issue in a responsible manner, in line with [responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) principles.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of our project:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | ✅ Fully supported |
| Older   | ❌ Not supported   |

For more details about specific support timelines, please refer to the individual project repositories.

If you are using an unsupported version, we strongly encourage you to upgrade to the latest release to benefit from the most recent security patches.

Thank you for helping us keep this project secure for everyone.
