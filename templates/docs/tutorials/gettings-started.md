Welcome to the tutorial! In this guide, we'll walk you through setting up your development environment and building your first project with our framework.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 2: Create Your First Component

Create a file called `MyComponent.js`:

```js
function MyComponent() {
  return <div>Hello, World!</div>;
}

export { MyComponent };
```
